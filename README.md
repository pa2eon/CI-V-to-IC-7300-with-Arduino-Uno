# IC-V-to-IC-7300-with-Arduino-Uno
This repository will give information (also for beginner Ham) to use the remote port (IC-V) on the IC-7300 transceiver to the Arduino UNO

Looking inside the menu of the IC-7300 you will find the IC-V settings.
To communicate via the USB-IC-V commands you can use the address 00h.
To communicate via the remote connector you can use the address 94h.
The 'CI-V transceive' you can leave, this option you can use to connect two IC-7300 together via the remote connection line.
